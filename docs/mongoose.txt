immutable : attribute which can be used to make value immutable in our schema
for example: createdDate -> once it is set it cannot be changed later, we can achieve that using above attribute in Schema

const RecipeSchema = Schema({
    name: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    createdDate: {
        type: Date,
        default: () => Date.now(), // if nothing is passed it will pass current dateTime as default value
        immutable: true // this makes this attribute as immutable meaning we cannot change it's value once it is assigned.
        valiate:{ // this helps us to add custom validation
            validator: v => v >= Date.now(),
            message: props => `${props.value} is below ${Date.now()}`
        }
    }
})
