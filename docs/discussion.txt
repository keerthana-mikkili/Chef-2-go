 *** we must have a middleware for all the api calls except login/ signup to check whether person is logged in or not

Order

we need to split it into cart and Order


Recipe:
    Recipe.find({name: searchTerm}) -> would return all the Recipes which matches the searchTerm // we will use regex to match -> [recipes] 
    Recipe.exist({name: searchTerm}) -> would return boolean either record exist or not!

Chef:
    User.find({name: searchTerm}) -> would search chef by name // will use regex -> [chefs]
    User.findOne({username: searchTerm}) -> would return one record, and we use exact match.
